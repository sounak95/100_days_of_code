'''
Nodes Greater Than X
Send Feedback
For a given a binary tree of integers and an integer X, find and return the total number of nodes of the given binary tree which are having data greater than X.
Input Format:
The first line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

The second line of input contains an integer, denoting the value of X.
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the total number of nodes where the node data is greater than X.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1 4 2 3 -1 -1 -1
2
Sample Output 1:
2
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
Out of the four nodes of the given binary tree, [3, 4] are the node data that are greater than X = 2.
Sample Input 2:
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
5
Sample Output 2:
3
